# Dynamics NAV C/Side Color theme for VSCode
## A VSCode color theme inspired by Microsoft Dynamics NAV C/Side Editor
This is a light color theme based on colors from our beloved old C/Side code editor. I hope familiar colors might help developers migrating from C/Side to VSCode AL.

* Editor background is not #FFFFFF white on purpose. I figured #FCFCFC would be better for night-long coding sessions. :)

### For more information
* [Github repo](https://github.com/martonsagi/nav-cside-color-theme): feel free to fork it or send feedback/pull requests.

### Credits
* [GitHub Plus Theme](https://github.com/thenikso/github-plus-theme) has been used as a base template because of its decent colors. It does not seem to have a specific license so I'm mentioning it to be sure.

**Enjoy!**
