# Dynamics NAV C/Side Color theme for VSCode
## A VSCode color theme inspired by Microsoft Dynamics NAV C/Side Editor
This is a light color theme based on colors from our beloved old C/Side code editor. I hope familiar colors might help developers migrating from C/Side to VSCode AL.

* Editor background is not #FFFFFF white on purpose. I figured #FCFCFC would be better for night-long coding sessions. :)

**Enjoy!**
